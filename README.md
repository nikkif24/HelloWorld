# Endless Learner
I have graduated at the University of La Verne with a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Computer Engineering. During my time at university I learned C++ Object Oriented and Data Structures, as well as Assembly. Over this course in time, I also learned Python, Java, and JavaScript in my free time. I also hold experience with Linxus, SQL, GitHub, and HTML. Overall, I hold a passion for problem solving and plan to continue expanding my knowledge throughout my life. With my job experience I have also worked with Arduino Uno, Multisim, and 3D Printing.

## My Goals
I hope to one day be a powerful female engineer. My current interests are Software, Systems, or Civil Engineering. I am looking for a start up to join and build with. With my experience I believe I can be a great benefit to a company.

## My Hobbies
I love to exercise my creativity through writing and art. In addition, nature has a big place in my heart. I have always loved reading. Recently I have expanded my interests into non-fiction books including history and self-help.
