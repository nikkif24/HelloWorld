# Student of the Universe 
As of now, I am a student at the University of La Verne working to recieve a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in Engineering. I am working on my own to learn about HTML and the benefits of GitHub. 

## My Goals
I hope to one day be a powerful female engineer. My current interests are environmental or software engineering. I am currently looking for internships to build my experience in the field. In addition, I hope to remain working on other creative skills that bring me joy. 

## My Hobbies
I love to exercise my creativity through writing and art. In addition, nature has a big place in my heart. 

## My Jewelry 
Currently I have been expressing myself by refurbushing old/used jewelery into new piece.
